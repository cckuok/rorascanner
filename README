RoraScanner README & INSTALLATION

By Rory McCune - raesene@gmail.com
=================================

RoraScanner is an Oracle security scanner which I started writing as part of my SANS GSOC Gold submission in 2007, and I'm dusting off now.

At the moment it's pretty basic with only a couple of checks implemented, but the intention is to improve this over time.  If there's any checks you'd like to see added
please just drop me a mail and I'll see what I can do.

RoraScanner is currently alpha level code, please don't run this on your production Oracle environment it's a bad idea (tm).  However please do run it on 
test environments and let me know how you get on :)


LICENSE
=======
RoraScanner and any supporting code written by me is licenced under the GPLv2.  

There are some supporting tools that can be used by RoraScanner, these tools are (obviously) copyright by their owners and licensed under their terms.



INSTALLATION
============

At the moment RoraScanner has only been installed and tested on Linux, most of it should work in windows, but don't be surprised if it doesn't.


Install Ruby 
============

You will need ruby installed to run RoraScanner.  

Linux
------
In linux the easiest way to do this will be to use your package manager of choice to install ruby

Yum/RPM based - yum install ruby, yum install rubygems
apt/dpkg based - apt-get install ruby, apt-get install rubygems

Alternatively, consider using rvm as a great way to get many rubies working (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)

Windows
-------

The easiest way to install ruby on windows, is to use the ruby installer found here (http://rubyinstaller.org/)


Install the Oracle Client
==========================

The oracle client programs can be downloaded and installed from Oracles site here - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html



Install Supporting Files
==============================

Run - "gem install ruport" from a command line to install ruport
Run - "gem install builder" to install builder

and install the oci8 library from the instructions at http://ruby-oci8.rubyforge.org/en/ .



Weak Password Checking
======================

RoraScanner can call checkpwd from Red database security to check for weak passwords.  
If you want to use this function get the latest version of the checker from 
http://www.red-database-security.com/software/checkpwd.html 
Then put the information about the program location and the location of any password lists you'd like to use into scanner.conf
RoraScanner will then call checkpwd for each user in the user list.




USAGE
=====

there are two executable scripts for RoraScanner.  the first oracle-scanner.rb makes a SQL*NET connection to an Oracle database and completes various queries

the required parameters are

-u <username>
-p <password>
-c <Connection String>

Optional parameters are

-d - Connect as SYSDBA
-o - Connect as SYSOPER

So an example of connection to a database with a SID of ORCL on a host 192.168.1.161 with a username of SYS (so need SYSDBA) and a password of PASSWORD would be

./oracle-scanner.rb -u SYS -p PASSWORD -c 192.168.1.161/ORCL -d


Rora_Scanner_Log is the default log file and should contain information about any errors encountered

=================

oracle-file-scanner.rb is designed to analyse various files to review security related parameters.  At the moment it's got a couple of checks for sqlnet.ora and listener.ora
as well as the ability to review the file permissions from unix installations of Oracle.

for sqlnet.ora

./oracle-file-scanner.rb -f sqlnet.ora

for listener.ora

./oracle-file-scanner.rb -f listener.ora

for reviewing file permissions on unix First go to the $ORACLE_HOME directory on your database server and run ls -alR > <output-file> then copy the output-file
to the RoraScanner directory then run

./oracle-file-scanner.rb -f <output-file> -u <oracle-user> -g <oracle-group>

Rora_File_Scanner_Log is the default log file and should contain information about any errors encountered

========

scanner.conf
============

This is the config file for the scanner.  You can use this to modify the log level or output file or to customise which checks you want to run.
